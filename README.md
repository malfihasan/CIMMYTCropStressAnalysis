# CIMMYT
A collaborative git project for CIMMYT Bangladesh and M. Alfi Hasan, PhD.  

An analysis of crop suitability was conducted and presented in this project. For each crop and their given optimum temperature threshold, the calculation of cumulative distribution function was conducted. From the probability of exceedance of the thresholds, interpolated surfaces were generated using the best-fitted kriging method. Some suitability maps were masked to identify the zone of risk corresponding to different crops. Finally, the difference between two selected climate periods was identified which give us the idea of changes in the suitability for each selected crop.
